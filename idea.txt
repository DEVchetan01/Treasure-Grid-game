Game Concept:
The game takes place on a grid.

The treasure ("ðŸ’°") is hidden at a random location.

Players ("P1", "P2", etc.) start at random positions.

If a player lands on the treasure, they win.

If two players land on the same spot, they are eliminated.

Players move every 5 seconds in a random direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally).
